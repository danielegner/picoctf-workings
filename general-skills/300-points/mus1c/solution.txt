Failed attempt 1:
Wrote a python script to strip all spaces from lyrics.txt and replace all instances of 'i' with '1'.
This flag was not accepted due to its length, so this approach must be a dead end.


Use a Rockstar interpreter to decode lyrics.txt:
The hint suggests the lyrics are code, written in an esoteric programming language called 'Rockstar'.
Go to https://codewithrockstar.com/online and paste the contents of lyrics.txt into the interpreter.


Save the output to a file and convert to ascii using a python script:
#!/usr/bin/env python3

print('picoCTF{', end='')

with open('rockstar-interpreted.txt', 'r') as f:
    for elem in f:
        print(chr(int(elem)), end='')

print('}')
