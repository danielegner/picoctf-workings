Download lyrics.txt:
$ wget https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/96904d361d61fada5bd2d13536706f9a/lyrics.txt


Using the docs at https://codewithrockstar.com/docs, manually decode lyrics.txt from Rockstar to readable:
The code checks STDIN input twice, and to print the flag you must provide input of '10' followed by '170'.


Run the lyrics code with the above input using https://codewithrockstar.com/online. Save the resulting output.


Convert output to ascii using python script:
#!/usr/bin/env python3

print('picoCTF{', end='')

with open('rockstar-output.txt', 'r') as f:
    for elem in f:
        print(chr(int(elem)), end='')

print('}')
